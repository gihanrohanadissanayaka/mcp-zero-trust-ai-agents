# MCP Zero-Trust AI Agents

A research project implementing a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** that enforces zero-trust security principles to control AI agent access to microservice backend infrastructure.

## Overview

This MCP server acts as a security gateway between AI agents and your microservice backend, implementing a comprehensive zero-trust access control strategy. Every request is authenticated, authorized, and monitored with built-in security controls.

## Core Features

- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permission management and authentication for AI agents accessing microservices
- **Logging & Auditing**: Comprehensive request and activity logging for security monitoring and compliance
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Data Masking**: Automatic masking of sensitive information (PII, credentials, etc.) in responses
- **Security Alerts**: Real-time alerting system for suspicious activities and security anomalies

## Key Objectives

✓ Implement zero-trust architecture for AI agent access control
✓ Provide centralized logging and audit trails
✓ Encrypt sensitive data transmissions
✓ Mask sensitive information in agent responses
✓ Alert users to potential security incidents

## Project Type

MSc Advanced Software Engineering Research Project
